# panicode

PaniCode is a kind of personal code that I use as a code generator that makes it easy to work on a project based on modules and classes.

## Server Reqruitments

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.4.8 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance issues, as well as missing features.
